By improving my Excel skills, I am able to analyse and display perfomance data in an effective and efficient way for athletes and coaches.

### Here is an example of some data analysis
<video width="960" height="720" controls>
    <source src="/assets/img/excel-vid.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

### This graph was made using PivotTable:
<div id="chart">
    <a class="chart">
<img src="/assets/img/chart.png" width="960" height="360">
</a>
</div>
